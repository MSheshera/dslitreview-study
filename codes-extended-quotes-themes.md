* understanding-discipline, 12
> Sure i've been doing full time research for about two years and so often when i'm starting work in a  problem ... i'm not sufficiently familiar with to work to really know what the typical approaches are, how is this evaluated, what kinds of approaches people are falling out of favor versus becoming more accepted by the community - PX
> 
> And then the second goal might be that when you are new to a field you might need to learn about some terminology of that field. So for example, right now I am exploring areas in RL which I am not aware of. So it is mostly to build my own vocabulary of how certain things are defined, what the different terminology are. ... And third to build the mental map of the whole field, where things exist. - PX
> 
> So when we get there was to get like familiarized with this like huge theoretical framework that exists understand how people were historically talking about it understand how people have since then changed how they talk about it, and today, how is it seen in the field. - PX

* action-seek-dataset, 8 
* action-seek-metrics, 4 
> And finally, like once I have formulated like a problem statement that i'm working on figuring out what the standard practices in terms of evaluation. - PX
> 
> Again, what types of .. benchmark tests are people doing for protocols like the ones that i'm trying to propose ... how do I assess proposal in a way that is appropriate for my for my audience - PX

* action-understand-problem, 11
> And then just maybe get a crux of stuff like what's the label space for the data sets, in a normal production setting its neighbors space is really big. What are some data sets that are more tractable How does that affect the numbers .. - PX
> 
> So my rationale in detail is to understand what parts of the problem is addressed, what are their assumptions, and lets say if I find something which i can improve upon - PX
> 
> while I tried to find the flaws in that and the shortcomings of those - PX

* action-seeking-similar-problems, 8
> The first question that comes to mind for any researcher is what has been already done, are there similar problems which have already been tackled Or related problems whose corresponding methods might be used in my problem and i use it. - PX
> 
> So this [Related Problems] section eventually would be an important section for that context, I would I would want to see what, and this is, I wouldn't say You know, like it or hate it and probably most people love Wikipedia but for most generic enough problems or keywords there is this section and it's an incredibly powerful section. I think I would go through these, not through all of these maybe like this one i'm less interested in, but these are absolutely all relevant sections, so I wil follow up on it. - PX

* seeking-survey-papers, 7
> What I [try] to do is start with a survey paper first. So that I know which papers to focus on and then based on that go deeper individually or those papers. - PX
> 
> You know, maybe or a blog post, which is actually doing a survey of the different methods in meta learning. - PX
> 
> Mostly i like to hear talks of keynote speakers or tutorials. Actually talks often do a literature review of a certain field. They do a good job of telling you where it is. - PX

> First stop I have found for a lot of theoretical work that I'm doing is Wikipedia, obviously you cant cite Wikipedia and you cant take its word for it, but it is a great resource. - PX

* seeking-latest-papers, 5
> Especially with a new papers if any related paper and which is not yet registered in Google scholar. Then that helps because in Google scholar it's difficult to find the most recent papers but Twitter when sometimes people upload. - PX

* seeking-influential-papers, 3
> Research everything, so you do keyword search and try to find papers that lead you to something like some paper that you can trust so. - PX
> 
> it's mostly trying to find the core papers that are very influential with regards to the topic and that's mostly through Google scholar where you see which ones have the most citations. - PX
> 
> I want to say i'm just unaware of this area in general, so. I want to find an older paper which people are excited to which, which has like a how the how the How the field like this particular sub area of domain generalization started. - PX

* action-seek-older-paper, 5
> There is one other thing about that discipline that made it challenging which was that that area was very active in like the 90s. And so, a lot of the papers that are relevant to our study where were older and so they're published in different venues, and they use different techniques and it was just some. It took it wasn't. The approaches that they use were not familiar to me. It made it much harder to skim papers. And things get to the essence of what. Is the contribution of that paper. - PX
> 
> Okay, but yeah I think this sort of challenge of like I think things are rediscovered in different circles waiting often things are also forgotten with. Like you're fine tables the 80s and the 90s. somewhat similar idea. What have you discovered in different contexts. and often it feels like we're doing the same kinds of like. we're doing the same thing again again. - PX 
> 
> This particular papers on 2010 so if I need to understand something very basic. Which isn't., Only present in papers which are which came earlier. - PX

* seeking-cross-domain-papers, 6
> So, because this context doesn't really hasn't existed before there's actually like  almost no existing research published research in my on my topic that it really exists on the Internet. And so i've had the new challenge of having to Look, for things that are like tangential to my texts - PX
> 
> And so it's very hard to sort of figure out whether it's been done before, or even sort of mapping some the same thing in one field to play this on any field us very specifically here Okay, but yeah I think this sort of challenge of like I think things are rediscovered in different circles waiting often things are also forgotten with.. - PX

[But] now I think that that's been on the on the back burner, it's not really something that's likely to materialize but i'm still interested in it. - PX

> And sometimes it happens with me that some papers I am building my ideas upon are very old. Like 2002, 2003. So in that case i need to find papers which are more relevant and recent to see if people are even working on something like this now. - PX

* ensuring-novelty, 10
> So sometimes it is just to see if someone has already done this. Like someone has exactly worked on this and has done a work like this. So its more to confirm that. Yeah so is it even a significant contribution, and to be honest can someone do it better. - PX

Whatever you are proposing, you need to locate it in the existing landscape of science and scientific literature. So its a duty but its also how we do research. Its the core of how you advance scientific knowledge in a way. - PX

> Is the situation where this research problem or research idea didn't come about as a result of previous research this came about because of a real world setting at my company, where a need was observed by engineers and users of the system And so I was You know sort of given this concept by researchers, or by by these people as a researcher to continue looking into it So in that context Now i'm looking at the existing literature to even see how do I connect this to the To what it really exists - PX
> 
> So those are the two modes of discussion. And sometimes if a paper is highly relevant to a project we are doing, more often with my lab mates. Lets say I am doing a project with someone, i schedule a meeting to discuss that paper in detail so that we understand different aspects of it and we can discuss what we are doing differently so that we can position our work better - PX

> 
> So for that I was reading papers focusing not only on developing new methods but how to apply those methods on real wold data. So I usually start with focusing on the main problem I am trying to solve, so under generalization formalizing it better and understanding under what settings it works. - PX

> I try to remember like, especially when i'm working on specific projects, I tried to make notes of papers, whose related work, I found was pretty extensive. - PX
> 
> Once I find a paper relevant to my interests, I will I will skim it, but even if it's even if it's not actually useful to my own research like I really don't think this has almost any application, but it uses those keywords then I'll skim the intro and related work sections to try to find Like statements that relate to what i'm doing and then look at the citations associated to those - PX
> 
>  I start closing in on my search around the time when I realized that every people i'm reading is taking about other papers I have also read, or at least come across like more in kind of like important papers in the area. - PX

* action-author-guided-discovery, 13
> Sometimes you find something which is very interesting or relevant so one thing i do ... is i go and check who the authors are and i go to their personal websites or their google scholar profiles to see what else they have published because it may be relevant as well. - PX 

* pp-keyword-mismatch, 5 (also pp-unfocussed-search)
> the choice of keywords is actually a pretty big issue ... because the keywords can lead you to wildly different places. ... I had to generalize my problem statement ... and look for statistical methods which merge or combine different estimators. So it just took me very long to find the right combination of keywords to find an existing method in the literature. - PX
> 
> I had an idea in my head, but I was not sure how to map this into like normative terms used by communities or even necessarily what communities are interested in this ... And in like ultimately it just took like trial and error like finding some papers and then coming back to it later and like over several weeks, I did the search different times and eventually kind of started to find things that find terms that actually matched. - PX
> 
> We thought about [problem] for a while and we ... got a bunch of results from that. ... A couple of weeks later, my advisor said he mentioned that he found some other paper ... he said that this problem actually has a name. So we found that there is there was some work done back in the 1980s and 90s with a completely different name for a very specific instance of our problem. So we were working on something ... we thought that no one actually had asked this question, we turned out to be wrong, and a small number of people were like literally writing 60 page papers on it. - PX
> 
> The non standard usage of terms is can be very much from the same discipline. In math the same term is used in very different contexts in different places, such as the term ``normal'' ... but those are ... things which you are on the lookout for so your alarm bells start ringing about Oh, I have to make sure that i'm not misreading this - PX (while reading)
> 
> The biggest challenge is in terms of looking beyond this niche into more general machine learning or maybe even beyond to see sort of like whether the general idea has been applied, and the various levels at which something would have been done. And the challenge is [that] different people described the same problem, using a different language, based on the fields they come from. - PX
> 
> The selection of the keywords for searching for the paper was very [hard]. I was stuck at the beginning, because I had limited knowledge and I used to search using the same keywords - PX

However in the code, I can simply look at the code and it's easier to find exactly what they did. - PX

> So a big part of [the frustration] is when there are incomplete details or a lot of things are assumed. - PX
